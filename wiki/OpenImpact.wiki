==Project Summary==
Open Impact is a project to help collect evidence of high impact research that has been undertaken in UK universities and to provide it to a range of stakeholders (government,
funders, press etc) through an independent third party agency (a learned society). The project will use a specific discipline (Computer Science) mediated through a particular society (the
British Computer Society) as an exemplar.
