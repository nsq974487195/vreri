*_Collecting and Communicating Evidence of Research Impact_*

==Project Summary==
Open Impact is a project to help collect evidence of high impact research that has been undertaken in UK universities and to provide it to a range of stakeholders (government,
funders, press etc) through an independent third party agency (a learned society). The project will use a specific discipline (Computer Science) mediated through a particular society (the
British Computer Society) as an exemplar. 

 * Twitter description: This project helps researchers tell the public why their work is remarkable and indispensable.
 * Questions this project answers: How can we piece together coherent stories about research impact and how can we do it without distracting researchers from doing research?
 * User Question: How can I increase my profile and sell my expertise, to my colleagues, industry, funders and the public?
 * Community Question: Can we build on recent initiatives to collect and manage research outputs (repositories) and research administration information (CRIS systems) to better market our researchcapacity and effectiveness to industry, government and the British taxpayer/voters?
