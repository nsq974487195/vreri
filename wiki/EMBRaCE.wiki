==Project Summary==
This project explores mechanisms for the development of large scale e-communities of owner-managers of smaller enterprises. The e-communities we wish to develop will be of use to knowledge transfer activities
between public sector and businesses and will be particularly useful for development of public policy and research agendum by various public policy and research institutions. This proposal looks at extensions to the
Northwest Regional Development Agency’s LEAD NW programme in order to quicken knowledge exchange (KE) between business and public sectors. We focus on evaluating the attributes of the service from a business
owner’s perspective and then determine feasibility of uncovered options that would lead to the development of an online e-community of over 1,250 business owners that are engaged on the Agency’s LEAD NW
Programme. Using Sakai as the e-community development tool, we examine how large numbers of Owner Managers can be e-managed to become part of a cohesive e-community of business leaders advising public
sector on urgent matters of the day, quickly, securely and efficiently; but also becoming a potent self supportive and cohesive voice for smaller businesses.
