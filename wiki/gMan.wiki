==Project Summary==
Building on the JISC funded projects TEXTvre and LaQuAT, gMan will address how VREs for everyday research in the humanities can be deployed on research infrastructures. LaQuAT
and TEXTvre both pioneer the particular opportunities for data-driven humanities. gMan will continue their work and look at how the UK and European Research Infrastructures (RIs) can
be exploited to support data-driven, collaborative research in the humanities. gMan will use the gCube environment, which allows virtual research communities to deploy VREs on demand
using shared data and services on the European RI, and which supports typical community data management services and advanced, distributed search and browse services. gMan will
look at new ways of integrating existing data resources for Classics and add services so that research work based on integrated resources can be published.
