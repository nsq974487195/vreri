=TEXTvre=
*_a complete VRE for the e-Humanities in textual studies by providing researchers with advanced services to process and analyse research texts_*

==Project Summary==
[The overall aim of TEXTvre is to support the complete lifecycle of research in e-Humanities textual studies by providing researchers with advanced services to process and analyse research texts that are held in formally managed, metadata-rich institutional repositories.

The access and analysis of textual research data will be supported by annotation and retrieval technology and will provide services for every step in the digital research life cycle. TEXTvre will build upon the success of the German TextGrid project, a collaborative environment for textual studies and a cornerstone in the emerging German e-Humanities agenda.

TEXTvre will adopt, evaluate and expand TextGrid solutions to UK community needs, broadening its community of practice, and bringing together key organisations in the domain of e-Humanities textual studies in the UK. TEXTvre will take pains to embed the VRE within the day-to-day research practices at the institution, and will integrate it fully with institutional repository and data management infrastructures. The project will also interoperate closely with national infrastructures, in the form of the NGS.]
