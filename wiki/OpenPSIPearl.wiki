==Project Summary==
OpenPSIPearl is a collaboration between the University of Southampton (UoS), the UK Government, and the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) part of The National Archive and leading academic research groups
with an interest in the use of UK government administrative datasets in combination with specifically provisioned survey data.

This OpenPSIPearl project will produce three deliverables;
 # a national scale exemplar of a 'linked data' research challenge to excite the UK research community. It will be grounded in a relevant research policy question of 'understanding the effect of positive activities and
opportunities within the locality of UK schools['content aggregation'];
 # an understanding of how provision of UK government 'linked data' will effect the methods and best practice in research use of administrative data in combination with additional survey data [critique of methods] and;
 # sustained collaboration via an ongoing articulation on the needs of the UK Research community for, and provision by the Government of non-personl Public Sector Information using the previously JISC Rapid Innovation funded OpenPSIportal (http://www.openpsi.org/prototypeservice).
