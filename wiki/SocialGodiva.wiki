_Combined environment for Environmental Scientists_

NOTE TO PROJECT ON THIS PAGE: If you see a correction/addition that needs to be made in this page please place edits in the comments section at the bottom of this page and I will change, please do not email me. /FvT

==Project Summary==
This project will combine two existing systems to create a new Virtual Research Environment for environmental scientists. By combining the capabilities of an
online environmental data visualization system with a sophisticated blogging and collaboration engine, we will rapidly create a new facility for scientists to collaborate on important data
analysis tasks, focussing here on the diagnosis of the latest cutting-edge numerical simulations of the climate and oceans,
