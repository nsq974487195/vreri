==Project Summary==
This project will combine two existing systems to create a new Virtual Research Environment for environmental scientists. By combining the capabilities of an online environmental data visualization system with a sophisticated blogging and collaboration engine, we will rapidly create a new facility for scientists to collaborate on important data analysis tasks, focussing here on the diagnosis of the latest cutting-edge numerical simulations of the climate and oceans.
