*_Combined environment for Environmental Scientists_*

==Project Summary==
This project will combine two existing systems to create a new Virtual Research Environment for environmental scientists. By combining the capabilities of an online environmental data visualization system with a sophisticated blogging and collaboration engine, we will rapidly create a new facility for scientists to collaborate on important data analysis tasks, focussing here on the diagnosis of the latest cutting-edge numerical simulations of the climate and oceans.

==Video introduction==
*Please find the 3 minute introduction to theBlogMyData project, from the VRERI Kick-off meeting at: http://vimeo.com/9853810 *.

_PROJECTS Please add: 
 * Twitter description (120 characters laymen description, e.g. how would you describe this to your neighbour and not bore them): *!BlogMyData will allow environmental scientists to collaborate on the interpretation of cutting-edge climate and ocean simulations.*
 * Questions this project answers (end user problems it solves): 
  * User Question (what itch does it scratch): *How can I work with my colleagues to interpret complex datasets, and how can I discover people with similar interests who can help with my problems?*
  * Community Question (how does this change the way things were done): *Can we create significant new collaborative capability through a simple mashup of existing systems?*
