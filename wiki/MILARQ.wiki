_Improving Search and Discovery Performance over Combined Data_

NOTE TO PROJECT ON THIS PAGE: If you see a correction/addition that needs to be made in this page please place edits in the comments section at the bottom of this page and I will change, please do not email me. /FvT

==Project Summary==
This MILARQ Project proposal seeks JISC funds to enhance performance of the CLAROS Explorer VRE, to allow wider public access to a rich set of classical art resources from major European research centres,
and incorporation of additional source data.

CLAROS (Classical Art Research Online Services; http://www.clarosnet.org/) provides search and discovery services over datasets that have been integrated, using state-of-the-art Semantic Web
technologies, from leading independent European research centres. The data web created from these datasets includes descriptions of classical art objects (pots, gems, statues, etc.) located in museums
worldwide.

The intended outcome of this project is a robust and performant publicly accessible Virtual Research Environment, the CLAROS Explorer, to be used by academic researchers, educators, students and
members of the public to access information about objects from classical antiquity, and their relationships with classical mythology.
The software developments relate to Jena, an existing, widely used, open source Semantic Web data management platform. These will include creation of multiple indexes over the underlying RDF triple
store, Jena TDB, and other optimizations relating to filter performance.

The project will run for 8 months from March 2010, employing 25%FTE of the developer who created the CLAROS data web, who will be involved in testing, deployment and evaluation, and engaging the
services of Epimorphics Ltd on a consultancy basis for software development, to ensure that the improvements are created most efficiently by those who best know the Jena code base, and to ensure
these improvements are suitable for integration into the open source code base and support on an ongoing basis, for the benefit of the entire Jena community that includes several other JISC projects. The
Epimorphics Ltd consultancy services are being offered at a very substantial discount on their full commercial rate, equivalent to a contribution in kind to the project of £11,750, because of the broad
benefits they see this project providing for the Jena community as a whole.
