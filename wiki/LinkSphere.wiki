*_a single virtual interface for searching across all the repositories and collections_*

==Project Summary==
[ The University of Reading has a large number of important repositories of archival data and collections of useful information. We will create a unified system that provides a single virtual interface for searching across all the repositories’ and collections, this will not only make the data and information more readily available, but also ensure that all the resources that need to be accessed would be easier to find and interact with.

Within this project we will also integrate a social network for researchers within the University of Reading that will show that such a system can help researchers get to know each other, enable collaboration and ensure that it is possible to work more closely together on cross-disciplinary projects. We believe that it is important that new and existing researchers get to meet each other virtually in a secure environment and also share information about their own research and development too.]
