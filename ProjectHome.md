# Welcome to the VRERI Wiki #

## TOP LINKS ##
The following links take you to the key parts of this wiki:

An overview of all the [Project Documentation](http://code.google.com/p/vreri/wiki/ProjectDocumentation) required for a VRERI funded project. This page includes important dates and links to templates for submitting postings/documentation.

## What is going on here? ##
This wiki is the Programme Manager's notebook on the VRERI programme.
Because it is a notebook is has errors and mistakes, however this online notebook is attempting to demonstrate good practice in transparency and FoI. We hope you will view this additional information as helpful and informative in that way.

Please see the JISC website for details on what [JISC](http://www.jisc.ac) is about and how to get involved. Also see the links on the right side of this page. Or please feel free to contact [Christopher Brown](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/contactus/staff/christopherbrown.aspx) with any questions.

## Who is this wiki for? ##
This wiki supports the projects of the new phase of VRE funding for VRE Rapid Innovation (VRERI) projects. These projects are part of the [JISC VRE programme](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/vre.aspx).

There are three expected audiences for this website (in order of significance):
  1. "**You the Project Manager**" so you can find out what you should be doing at various stages in the project (and what/how other projects are doing).
  1. "**The Powers That Be**" aka the money holders and auditors so they can have an overall view of how the money is being spent.
  1. "**Other Developers**" interested in the work that is being done here

## How does this work? ##
On this wiki projects will report their progress in the form of blogs. These posts can be read by the larger audience as the projects are running. (instead of the ‘old fashioned’ reporting after doing…)This way the community of projects can learn **while** doing!

Here, you are on the "Project Home" page/tab (which is really the "Programme Home" by JISC terminology but nevermind) this page describes the overall Programme status, the other tabs/pages have the following information:
  * **Downloads**: any downloads that the programme manager wants to pass to projects or any items that the project want to pass one another.
  * **Wiki**: This will primarily be a place where the programme manager will keep notes on the various processes projects should carry out as well as general notes on what is going on with each project. Otherwise, it is a a sandbox where anyone can come and create a page, the programme manager will highlight pages via a table of contents [(ToC)](http://code.google.com/p/vreri/wiki/TableofContents) page below.

As Project manager **your best starting point** is to have a look at the project documentation requirements page and take it from there: [ProjectDocumentation](http://code.google.com/p/vreri/wiki/ProjectDocumentation) on the wiki.

The following are lists of the VRERI projects in various groupings:
  * [VRERI Project that are currently active](http://code.google.com/p/vreri/w/list?can=2&q=status%3Aincomplete&colspec=PageName+Summary+Changed+ChangedBy)
  * [VRERI Project that have completed their funded work](http://code.google.com/p/vreri/w/list?can=2&q=status%3Acomplete&colspec=PageName+Summary+Changed+ChangedBy)

## What is **rapid Innovation** anyway? ##
In 2008 JISC started with the first round of funding Rapid Innovation projects in the [JISCRI programme](http://code.google.com/p/jiscri/).

This way of funding allows a larger number of smaller/cheaper projects. This in turn allows academics to trial solutions and try out more innovative things and approaches. You will find an entertaining yet informative introduction to Rapid innovation on the JISCRI site above.

## DISCLAIMER ##
This wiki is an experiment and so feedback is greatly appreciated. I have a monitor set on all the comments areas, so feel free to send opinions that way
(if you want a response make sure to make me aware of the handle you are using).
